SlimStarter
===========

SlimStarter is a bootstrap application built with Slim Framework in MVC architecture,
with Laravel's Eloquent as database provider (Model) and Twig as template engine (View).

Originaly created by xsanisty, the project was a litte bit forbiden (his lastest commit was about 2 years ago)
but after a few hours of testing i found it a very nice 'frankestain' framework and decide it to fork it and give it life again!
